#Exercise 4 for loops
#Create a python program that displays all even numbers from 1 to 100 using for loops

# Displaying even numbers from 1 to 100 using a for loop
for i in range(1, 101):
    if number % 2 == 0:
        print(i)

# Displaying odd numbers from 1 to 100 using a for loop
for i in range(1, 101):
        if number % 2 != 0:
            print(i)
